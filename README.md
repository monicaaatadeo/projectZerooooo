## About Game

- This is a click-based game
- You will only have 5 seconds to click as many shapes as you can
- Each shape generates a different point values between 0 to 20 
- Based on these values, you will receive your score once the timer ends 
- Your ultimate goal is to click as many/most shapes as you can in order to clear the board and receive max amount of points

I originally wanted to have a variety of shapes and each shape and size would be a different, but consistent point value. Then, as the points would increase, there would be a star at the bottom growing, as your point value increases as well.

## Known Bugs

The only known bug that I found was, you can click all the shapes even before pressing the **"Start Game"** button, and all points will log in even before starting the game. In short, you can win the game before initializing start/timer.
