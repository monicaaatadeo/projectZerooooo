Project #0 -- make your own game


"A Growing Star"

 	• This is a timed, clicked-based game 	
 	• You will receive points by clicking on different shapes with different sizes
 	• These shapes and sizes all have different values, and this results with the amount of points that will go into your scoreboard
 	• As you gain more and more points, there will be a star at the bottom of the screen. This star grows based on the amount of points your receive/are receiving 
 	• Your ultimate goal is to grow your star and try to get as many points as you can based on the different shapes & sizes
